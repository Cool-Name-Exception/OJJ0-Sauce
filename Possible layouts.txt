Basic paranthesis:
  a = .+(0, 1, 2);

one liners
  a .+(0, 1, 2);
  
  ??+
  
  
  -----------------------------
  
  
  We can either take the whole file as one strign or reade it character for character.
  I think the later is the most practical. 
  Everything is stored as string values, but not in the "same" string. Will be a mess to save it in "one" string(ofc this will be a mess either way).
  
  
  Everything before/between ";" is unice pieces of code.
  for example
  "
  int a .= 5; int b .= a;
"
. Their seen as seperate expressions.
