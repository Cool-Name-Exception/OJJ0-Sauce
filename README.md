OJJ0 is a programming language build on c.
It is an intepreter taking in the source file as a string. Then it tokenizes the string an does a lexical analysis.
For this we have chossen to buld our own lexer.
We will also make our own parser. The function of the parser is to make an Abstract Syntax Tree, structured tokens.




IMPORTANT!!!!!
WE MUST AGREE ON WHICH VERSION/COMPILER WE ARE GOING TO USE.
